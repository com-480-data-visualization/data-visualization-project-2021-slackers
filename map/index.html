      <h2>Conscientiousness</h2>

      <p class="even">
        Conscientiousness is a tendency to display self-discipline, act
        dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside
        expectations. It is related to the way in which people control,
        regulate, and direct their impulses. High conscientiousness is often
        perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness is
        associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as
        sloppiness and lack of reliability. High scores on conscientiousness
        indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. The
        average level of conscientiousness rises among young adults and then
        declines among older adults.

    <div class="Neuroticism" id="neuroticism" style="display: block">
      <h2>Neuroticism</h2>

      <p class="odd">
        Neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as
        anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional
        instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability.
        According to Hans Eysenck's (1967) theory of personality, neuroticism is
        interlinked with low tolerance for stress or aversive stimuli.
        Neuroticism is a classic temperament trait that has been studied in
        temperament research for decades, before it was adapted by the Five
        Factors Model. Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally
        reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to interpret
        ordinary situations as threatening. They can perceive minor frustrations
        as hopelessly difficult. They also tend to be flippant in the way they
        express emotions. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for
        unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad
        mood. For instance, neuroticism is connected to a pessimistic approach
        toward work, to certainty that work impedes personal relationships, and
        to higher levels of anxiety from the pressures at work. Furthermore,
        those who score high on neuroticism may display more skin-conductance
        reactivity than those who score low on neuroticism. These problems in
        emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high
        on neuroticism to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively
        with stress. Lacking contentment in one's life achievements can
        correlate with high neuroticism scores and increase one's likelihood of
        falling into clinical depression. Moreover, individuals high in
        neuroticism tend to experience more negative life events, but
        neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life
        experiences. Also, individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to
        have worse psychological well-being. At the other end of the scale,
        individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are
        less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and
        free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings
        does not mean that low-scorers experience a lot of positive feelings.
        Neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the
        Freudian sense (i.e., neurosis.) Some psychologists prefer to call
        neuroticism by the term emotional instability to differentiate it from
        the term neurotic in a career test.
