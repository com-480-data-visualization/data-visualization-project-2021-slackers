    <div id="first-trait" class="Openness" style="display: block">
      <h2>Openness</h2>

      <p class="odd">
        Openness to experience is a general appreciation for art, emotion,
        adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of
        experience. People who are open to experience are intellectually
        curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new
        things. They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more
        <b>creative</b>
        and more aware of their feelings. They are also more likely to hold
        unconventional beliefs. High openness can be perceived as
        unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky
        behavior or drug-taking. Moreover, individuals with high openness are
        said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense,
        euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain
        fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and
        data-driven — sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded.
        Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the
        openness factor.

    <div class="Extraversion" style="display: block">
      <h2>Extraversion</h2>

      <p class="even">
        Extraversion is characterized by breadth of activities (as opposed to
        depth), surgency from external activity/situations, and energy creation
        from external means. The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with
        the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are
        often perceived as full of energy. They tend to be <b>enthusiastic</b>,
        action-oriented individuals. They possess high group visibility, like to
        talk, and assert themselves. Extraverted people may appear more dominant
        in social settings, as opposed to introverted people in this setting.
        Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than
        extraverts. They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less
        involved in the social world. Their lack of social involvement should
        not be interpreted as shyness or depression; instead they are more
        independent of their social world than extraverts. Introverts need less
        stimulation, and more time alone than extraverts. This does not mean
        that they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are reserved in
        social situations. Generally, people are a combination of extraversion
        and introversion, with personality psychologist Hans Eysenck suggesting
        a model by which individual neurological differences produce these
        traits.

    <div class="Agreeableness" style="display: block">
      <h2>Agreeableness</h2>

      <p class="odd">
        The agreeableness trait reflects individual differences in general
        concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value
        <b> getting along with others </b>. They are generally considerate,
        kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to
        compromise their interests with others. Agreeable people also have an
        optimistic view of human nature. Disagreeable individuals place
        self-interest above getting along with others. They are generally
        unconcerned with others' well-being, and are less likely to extend
        themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about others'
        motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative. Low
        agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people,
        which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy. Because
        agreeableness is a social trait, research has shown that one's
        agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships
        with one's team members. Agreeableness also positively predicts
        transformational leadership skills. In a study conducted among 169
        participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions,
        individuals were asked to take a personality test and have two
        evaluations completed by directly supervised subordinates. Leaders with
        high levels of agreeableness were more likely to be considered
        transformational rather than transactional. Although the relationship
        was not strong (r=0.32, β=0.28, p&lt;0.01), it was the strongest of the
        Big Five traits. However, the same study showed no predictive power of
        leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader's direct supervisor.
        Conversely, agreeableness has been found to be negatively related to
        transactional leadership in the military. A study of Asian military
        units showed leaders with a high level of agreeableness to be more
        likely to receive a low rating for transformational leadership skills.
        Therefore, with further research, organizations may be able to determine
        an individual's potential for performance based on their personality
        traits. For instance, in their journal article "Which Personality
        Attributes Are Most Important in the Workplace?" Paul Sackett and Philip
        Walmsley claim that conscientiousness and agreeableness are important to
        success across many different jobs.

    <div class="Conscientiousness" style="display: block">
      <h2>Conscientiousness</h2>

      <p class="even">
        Conscientiousness is a tendency to display self-discipline, act
        dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside
        expectations. It is related to the way in which people control,
        regulate, and direct their impulses. High conscientiousness is often
        perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness is
        associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as
        sloppiness and lack of reliability. High scores on conscientiousness
        indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. The
        average level of conscientiousness rises among young adults and then
        declines among older adults.

    <div class="Neuroticism" style="display: block">
      <h2>Neuroticism</h2>

      <p class="odd">
        Neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as
        anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional
        instability, or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability.
        According to Hans Eysenck's (1967) theory of personality, neuroticism is
        interlinked with low tolerance for stress or aversive stimuli.
        Neuroticism is a classic temperament trait that has been studied in
        temperament research for decades, before it was adapted by the Five
        Factors Model. Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally
        reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to interpret
        ordinary situations as threatening. They can perceive minor frustrations
        as hopelessly difficult. They also tend to be flippant in the way they
        express emotions. Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for
        unusually long periods of time, which means they are often in a bad
        mood. For instance, neuroticism is connected to a pessimistic approach
        toward work, to certainty that work impedes personal relationships, and
        to higher levels of anxiety from the pressures at work. Furthermore,
        those who score high on neuroticism may display more skin-conductance
        reactivity than those who score low on neuroticism. These problems in
        emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high
        on neuroticism to think clearly, make decisions, and cope effectively
        with stress. Lacking contentment in one's life achievements can
        correlate with high neuroticism scores and increase one's likelihood of
        falling into clinical depression. Moreover, individuals high in
        neuroticism tend to experience more negative life events, but
        neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life
        experiences. Also, individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to
        have worse psychological well-being. At the other end of the scale,
        individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are
        less emotionally reactive. They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and
        free from persistent negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings
        does not mean that low-scorers experience a lot of positive feelings.
        Neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the
        Freudian sense (i.e., neurosis.) Some psychologists prefer to call
        neuroticism by the term emotional instability to differentiate it from
        the term neurotic in a career test.
